## 0.2.0

- feat; run the website's scheduled jobs (live lobby cleanup, match results, ratings harvest, account merge)
- security; steam ids are linked only when no other account owns them (staff resolve conflicts), match results and ratings come only from Relic, emails no longer leak in expanded records, overlays move to overlay.coh1stats.com, and the desktop app refreshes its session, sanitizes notifications and no longer ships the Steam API key
- feat; unlock rewards: admins create rewards with a 150x150 image, title, description and conditions (matches played or won per faction, mode, map, ranked, Pro or high-ELO lobby and match length; upset wins, win streaks, rating reached, hours played, matches recorded; reputation, comments, replies, upvotes given and received, replays uploaded or downloaded; profile complete, account age, hours streamed, fair play matches and overlay published); players unlock them automatically (past matches count too) with a notification; unlocked rewards show as icons under the bio on player profiles in the app and on the website (hover for title and description), and on your own profile locked rewards show too, with your progress
- fix; players who start the same match at the same moment no longer save it twice; a second report fills in what the saved match is still missing, and matches already saved twice are merged into one
